<!-- Notes from Andrew Peevler...

10.0.0.x = MEDIA Network
10.11.128.x = OPERATIONS network... everything cinema-related except MEDIA

Problem:  When the iMac's ethernet connection is active, the iMac cannot access the internet!

### Cable Label Convention

Each end of a cable should be labeled following this convention:

  `DeviceCode.Port - Network or Cable Type - DeviceCode.Port`

Labels should be applied such that the `DeviceCode.Port` corresponding to a particular device is nearest that device.  This will require placing one of the labels "upside down". \*See the first example below for clarification.  

#### Examples

  - A `THEATRE` network cable running from device `R`, port 1, to an unidentified port on device `F` will have a pair of labels marked `R.1 - THEATRE - F.x`.  \*For example, at device `R` the `R.1` end of the label should be nearest device `R`, while at device `F` the `F.x` end of that label should be nearest device `F`.
  - A `USB` cable running from an unidentified port on device `L` to an `In` port on device `X` will carry a pair of lables marked `L.x - USB - X.In`.
  - An `HDMI-to-DVI` cable running from the `Out` port on device `H` to a `DVI` port on device `P` will be labeled `H.Out - HDMI-to-DVI - P.DVI`.
