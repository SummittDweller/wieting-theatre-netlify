Perhaps the greatest factor in the Wieting's early success was its manager - John G. Wieting, or Guy, as he was more commonly known. Guy was a nephew of Dr. P. G. Wieting, and he had a knack for show business. He became the theater's first and only salaried manager earning $30 per month, a position he held for many years until his death.

He immediately associated the theatre with the best booking companies out of New York City. Those who still remember Guy will recollect that he also traveled for specialties and had a store here. His father operated a hotel where the Toledo post office now stands.
