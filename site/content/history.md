What follows is a very brief telling of the long history of Toledo's Wieting Theatre presented in 8 parts. It's worth noting up front that the Wieting opened in 1912 and celebrated it's first centennial in 2012. With considerable luck and the hard work of the Wieting Theatre Guild, Trustees and many volunteers, the Wieting marked this grand milestone with completion of extensive renovations of the theatre.

Also worth noting... the theatre is one of four structures in Toledo (including the Tama County Courthouse, jail and the old Toledo fire station) on the National Register of Historic Places. Did you know there is another Wieting Theatre still in operation? It's true. The community of Worcester, NY, is home to that other theatre.
