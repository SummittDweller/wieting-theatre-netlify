The Wieting Theatre is a community-owned non-profit organization supported by more than 100 dedicated volunteers. There is no paid staff, this is a labor of love.  

The _Wieting Trustees_ focus on the long-term health of the facility, while members of the _Wieting Theatre Guild_ manage daily operations, maintain the facility, and staff all events.  This dedicated group works together in an effort to support and maintain the Wieting Theatre. Their responsibilities include: monitoring movies, general building maintenance, scheduling and booking movies, and scheduling volunteer workers.

We tend to take for granted all the devoted and hardworking individuals who volunteer their time and effort to support the Wieting.  We want to reassure them of their importance and our gratitude for their hours spent toward the achievement of a common goal - that of keeping the Wieting Theatre facility available to our children and all adults in our communities.   Again - Many Thanks!
